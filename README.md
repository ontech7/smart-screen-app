## Smart Screen

To make it work properly, you'll need [Smart Screen](https://github.com/ontech7/smart-screen)

## Run & Build

To build it, you'll need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for NPM and Node itself, as well as [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and its Android SDK tools (that you can download directly from the IDE).

You need to install all the packages first:

`npm install`

And after that, you need to build the Android Studio project in platforms/android

## Settings

You can set up

- Local IP of the device that it's running SmartScreen
- City for weather* (e.g.: Milan,it)
- RSS news feed link
- Notification filters
- Disable Pointer (if using Desktop environment)
- Clear Notifications

&ast; You'll need an open-weather account in order to set the API KEY inside the main project (see [SmartScreen](https://github.com/ontech7/smart-screen))

## Sorry

The UI is poorly designed.
